- 👩🏻‍⚕️ I'm a registered nurse with extensive experience in healthcare.
- 📚 I’m currently a graduate student at Stony Brook University pursuing a Master of Science in Applied Health Informatics. I aspire to be good in this field.
- 🎯 I feel inspired when I'm part of a team or organization that fosters empowerment, encourages growth, and inspires me to dream big and achieve success while still embracing my fun-loving side.
- 👩🏻‍💻 I’m excited to collaborate with like-minded individuals who can share their knowledge, skills, and some fun personality with me. Although I might appear aloof at first, I’m actually quite nice and fun to be around once you get to know me. Shoot me a message!😉
- ⚡️ Fun fact: I'm an indoor plant enthusiast, I can eat a bag of Kinder Bueno chocolate in one sitting, I love karaoke, and lately, I've been enjoying K-drama series. When I feel active, I enjoy spending time in local parks.🌿🍫🎤📺🌳
- ❣️ Pronouns: she/her
